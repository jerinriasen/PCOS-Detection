This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women based on various health and diagnostic indicators provided in a CSV dataset. 
PCOS is a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management.
The model built in this project will help in predicting the likelihood of a woman having PCOS, based on clinical data.
